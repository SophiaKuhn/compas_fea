Finite element analysis, or the finite element method, is a numerical approach
to solving a variety of problems in the sciences, mathematics and engineering.
In a broad sense, a continuum such as a fluid or solid volume, is discretised into
a set of discrete elements. For each element, values of interest, such as stresses,
displacements, temperature and so on, are found at the nodes and at element
integration points. They are then interpolated for values across the element
with shape functions. The greater the number of elements used to represent the
continuum, the better the numerical model will represent the original continuous
solution. The finite element method is often used in practice, as closed-form
solutions for the continua cases can be difficult or impossible to ascertain,
and so a numerical approximation is sought.

The compas_fea package seeks to aid the user, be they an architect, scientist or
engineer, in creating a suitable model for their problem. This is done by
creating a Structure object, or class, to contain geometric information about the
model, and then to apply loads, displacements, materials etc for a subsequent
analysis. This construction of the Structure class may be performed in a pure
scripting manner, or through various modules that help construct the
object through a present or parametrically generated geometry. Once the
model has been constructed it may be analysed, through a finite element solver in
the background, with the data then stored either back into the original class and/or
as raw data text files. The data can then be post-processed to display the results
either through the standard compas viewers, or with visualisation support from
specific CAD software or the original finite element package.

By using the compas_fea package, the majority of the repetitive scripting tasks needed to
perform a geometrically or structurally complex analysis is eliminated, allowing
for the rapid investigation of single or parametric models, with easy to use and
streamlined data post-processing and visualisation support. Note, that although
finite element analysis has established itself as the preferred analysis method
in a variety of fields, it is prudent to construct a model that closely represents
the physical problem. As such, the results of a finite element analysis should
always be checked with hand calculations, intuition, experience, and ideally
reviewed by someone skilled in the field before the results are taken as "correct".
