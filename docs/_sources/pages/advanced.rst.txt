The simplest **PointLoad** and **GravityLoad** objects were described in the Basics topic, a few more **Load** types are described here.

The **TributaryLoad** can be used to distribute an area load applied to a mesh, as concentrated loads to the nodes of the **Structure** object. The class first takes the ``structure`` to apply the loads to, then the ``name`` of the tributary load, a **Mesh** datastructure object with ``mesh``, and finally ``x``, ``y`` and ``z``. The **Mesh** datastructure will take the area loads of ``x``, ``y`` and ``z`` (pressures in Pa), calculate the tributary area of each vertex, and multiply this area by the pressure to get a concentrated load in the component direction. The ``.components`` attribute of the **TributaryLoad** object will then be a dictionary of node keys and for a dictionary of concentrated forces. The class could be used in the following manner:

.. code-block:: python

   from compas_fea.structure import TributaryLoad

   mdl.add_load(TributaryLoad(structure=mdl, name='load_tributary', mesh=mesh, z=-2000))
