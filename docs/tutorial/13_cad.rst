This page shows how to utilise computer aided design and graphics software with the **compas_fea** package, for assisting in creating a **Structure** and viewing results from an analysis. The ``blender`` (currently in development for beta version 2.80) or ``rhino`` module of the **compas_fea** package needs to be imported to have access to this functionality:

.. code-block:: python

    from compas_fea.cad import rhino  # import the Rhino module for compas_fea

.. code-block:: python

    from compas_fea.cad import blender  # import the Blender module for compas_fea


========
Geometry
========

------
Layers
------

In Rhino, the function ``add_nodes_elements_from_layers()`` is used to extract Rhino geometry data from the model workspace and place it in the **Structure** object. The function takes a list argument ``layers``, containing the layer string names (or a single string for one layer) of where to scrape the geometric data from. The Rhino geometry in these layers will be given the same ``line_type`` element or ``mesh_type`` element when added to the **Structure**. The ``line_type`` and ``mesh_type`` are the string names of the element types for the classes in **compas_fea.structure.element**. All of the associated element nodes will be added automatically, there is no need to add Rhino points to represent these. For example, to add lines that are contained in Rhino layer ``'elset_elements'`` to the **Structure** named **mdl**, as **TrussElement** objects, use the code below. The **TrussElement** objects will be sent to ``mdl.elements`` and the created nodes (the line endpoints) will be added to ``mdl.nodes``.

.. code-block:: python

    rhino.add_nodes_elements_from_layers(structure=mdl, line_type='TrussElement', layers='elset_elements')

If ``mesh_type`` is given for 2D elements, for example as ``'ShellElement'`` or ``'MembraneElement'``, Rhino meshes on the given layers will have their faces individually added as elements to the **Structure**.

.. code-block:: python

    rhino.add_nodes_elements_from_layers(structure=mdl, mesh_type='ShellElement', layers='elset_shells')

If ``mesh_type`` is one of the solid element types ``'HexahedronElement'``, ``'TetrahedronElement'``, ``'SolidElement'`` or ``'PentahedronElement'``, Rhino meshes on the layers will be treated as a solid and not broken into individual faces.

.. code-block:: python

    rhino.add_nodes_elements_from_layers(structure=mdl, mesh_type='HexahedronElement', layers='elset_solids')

In Blender, the function with the same name (``add_nodes_elements_from_layers``) is used slightly differently, as there are no clear line type objects in Blender, instead, Blender meshes should exist in the given argument ``layers``. Once the meshes are picked-up from the layers, the vertices of the Blender meshes will be added to the **Structure** object as nodes, along with line elements represented by the edges of the meshes and added as element type ``line_type``, and shell elements represented by the faces of the meshes and added as element type ``mesh_type``. If the entire Blender mesh is to be used as a solid element, similar to the Rhino procedure above, then the function must be given a solid element type for ``mesh_type``.

.. code-block:: python

    blender.add_nodes_elements_from_layers(structure=mdl, line_type='TrussElement', mesh_type='ShellElement', layers=['elset_trusses', 'elset_shells'])

Adding nodes and elements from layers with the ``add_nodes_elements_from_layers()`` function, in both the Rhino and Blender cases, will return the lists of the node keys and element keys that were added.

.. code-block:: python

    nodes, elements = rhino.add_nodes_elements_from_layers(structure=mdl, line_type='TrussElement', layers=['elset_struts'])

    >>> print(nodes)  # print the nodes that were added
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]

    >>> print(elements)  # print the elements that were added
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, ... 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58]


----------
Local axes
----------

When adding line and mesh edge geometry from layers to the **Structure** object as **Element** objects, the function ``add_nodes_elements_from_layers()`` will also attempt to store the elements' local axis in the dictionary ``.axes`` of the **Element** object. To recall, this dictionary takes keys ``'ex'``, ``'ey'`` and ``'ez'`` to store a list (the vectors) of each element's local axis direction. The function will look at the name of the object through ``rs.ObjectName()`` in Rhino, check that it is in a ``.json`` dictionary type format, and then attempt to extract lists of these axis vectors from keys ``'ex'``, ``'ey'`` and ``'ez'``. The ``'ez'`` direction is not explicitly needed for line type elements, as it is the direction the straight line passes through from start to end point. While ``'ex'`` and ``'ey'`` correspond to the local `x` (major) and local `y` (minor) axes, looking along the line element from start to finish, i.e. along ``'ez'``. Orientations ``'ex'`` and ``'ey'`` are important for getting the correct local orientation of beam cross-sections. In Rhino 6, the name string of the object should contain an underscore at the start, for example as ``'_{'ex': [1, 0, 0]}``, as Rhino no longer accepts starting a name with curly braces. In Blender it is more straight-forward, simply add the axes to the ``.ex``, ``.ey`` and ``.ez`` object properties as lists.

For shell elements, the local ``'ex'`` axis is usually taken by default as the vector from the first node to the second, with ``'ey'`` then orientated in the plane of the shell element and perpendicular to ``'ex'``. This leaves ``'ez'`` as the normal of the shell element, taken by the cross-product of ``'ex'`` and ``'ey'``. In the same way that ``add_nodes_elements_from_layers()`` will look at the name of the object to extract ``'ex'`` and ``'ey'``, the same will be done for shell elements. If the user wants each face of a mesh to have a different axes orientation, then each face should be spilt as its own object, with the object name containing the axes information for that face, or, the ``.axes`` attribute of the elements can be manually set after the elements have been added.


===========
Adding sets
===========

To add Rhino geometry held in layers as sets of the **Structure** object, use the ``add_sets_from_layers()`` function. This function requires the ``structure`` to add the set to, and the ``layers`` to extract Rhino geometry from. Each layer in the list ``layers`` should exclusively contain Rhino points for node sets or Rhino line or mesh objects for element sets, otherwise it is not possible to determine that all **guids** in that layer contribute to a node or element set. The name of the set does not need be given, as the function will ensure that added sets inherit the layer names as their keys. If the layer is nested such that it has a name ``'a::b::c'``, then only the last part of the string, i.e. ``'c'``, will be used as the name.

.. code-block:: python

    rhino.add_sets_from_layers(structure=mdl, layers=['nset_pins', 'nset_load', 'elset_elements'])

The Blender equivalent functions are ``add_nsets_from_layers()`` and ``add_elsets_from_layers()``, where the former function will add vertices from Blender meshes and origins of empty objects as a node set, and the latter function will add an element set from edges and faces.

.. code-block:: python

    blender.add_nsets_from_layers(structure=mdl, layers=['nset_supports', 'nset_pins'])  # add node sets

    blender.add_elsets_from_layers(structure=mdl, layers='elset_elements')  # add element set


=============
Plotting data
=============

Once the **Structure** object has been analysed (see the Analysis topic of the documentation) and the data stored in ``structure.results``, it can be plotted in the CAD environment after a small amount of post-processing (see the Processing subsection below). The plotting of these data uses the ``plot_data()`` function of the Rhino and Blender modules, which requires the ``structure`` to get the data from, the ``step`` to plot, and the ``field`` of interest. For element based data, the ``iptype`` and ``nodal`` string arguments need to be given. Data are currently plotted on simple meshes representing the deformed geometry, these are simple tubular meshes of given ``radius`` to represent 1D elements, 2D meshes to represent shells and membranes, and separate voxel based viewing for 3D solid elements.

For Rhino, the meshes will be plotted in either the given ``layer`` name string, or a default layer named **step-field**, for which the layer will first be cleared if it already exists. This function call could look like the following, where a terminal print will show afterwards how much time the post-processing took:

.. code-block:: python

    rhino.plot_data(mdl, step='step_load', field='um', radius=0.1)  # plot magnitude of displacements um for step_load

    ***** Data processed : 0.211 s *****

.. code-block:: python

    rhino.plot_data(mdl, step='step_load', field='sxx', nodal='max', iptype='mean')  # plot stresses sxx for step_load

    ***** Data processed : 4.539 s *****

A typical Rhino and Blender environment after plotting data would look like:

.. image:: /_images/mesh_floor_rhino.png
   :scale: 27 %


.. image:: /_images/mesh_floor_blender.png
   :scale: 29 %


To plot voxel data for solid element results, use the ``.plot_voxels()`` function of the ``blender`` and ``rhino`` modules. This function uses the ``VtkViewer`` from the main **compas.viewers** package and requires that the user has the visualisation tool-kit (Vtk) installed. This function requires the following arguments: the ``structure`` object to extract data from, the ``step`` of interest, the ``field`` to plot, the ``iptype`` and ``nodal`` strings for element data, a ``cbar`` list to trim data, and an approximate voxel size ``vdx`` for interpolating data in space. The call and output from this function would look similar to:

.. code-block:: python

    blender.plot_voxels(structure=mdl, step='step_load', field='smises', vdx=0.1, cbar=[0, 1.5])


.. image:: /_images/block_tets_blender.png
   :scale: 30 %

----------
Processing
----------

A degree of data post-processing is performed on the raw data in ``structure.results`` before plotting, through the function ``postprocess()`` of the **compas_fea.utilities.functions** module. This post-processing requires NumPy and SciPy to be available for efficiency in handling large models, and so is carried out in a subprocess (via **compas.utilities** XFunc) for non-CPython based CAD environments like Rhino. The function calls a selection of other functions contained within the same module which do the following:

- Calculate the deformed nodal co-ordinates with given ``scale`` factor, which becomes the plot meshes vertex co-ordinates.

- Process element data based on the ``iptype`` and ``nodal`` strings, see the paragraph below for a more detailed explanation of what this involves.

- Normalise the data between -1 and 1 using the largest absolute value in the data.

- Calculate the colour to plot each vertex of the plot meshes using a data value from a consistent colour spectrum.

- Cap colour values based on the minimum and maximum trim values given in the ``cbar`` colorbar limits list.

Because the raw nodal data in ``structure.results`` contains single float values for each node, these values can be plotted directly as vertex colours on the plotting meshes. However, as there are in general multiple element data values for each element, some post-processing must be done to convert elemental data to suitable colour values at the nodes. The first step that the ``postprocess()`` function will do for elemental data, is convert all of the integration and section point data for an element to a user-directed single value with ``iptype``. The string ``iptype`` can be ``'mean'``, ``'max'`` or ``'min'``, to take the average, maximum positive or minimum negative value of the element data. The next step is to use this data and convert it a nodal value, as each node will connect to many elements and so have many adjacent element data values. Either ``'mean'``, ``'max'`` or ``'min'`` is given as a string for ``nodal``, giving then a value at each node based on all elements that connect to it. So for example, to find conservatively the most heavily loaded nodal Von Mises stress value from elemental data, one would use:

.. code-block:: python

    plot_data(mdl, step='step_load', field='smises', iptype='max', nodal='max')  # max values of smises to nodal data

and to plot the most compressive axial stress values use (with compression negative and local 'x' axis):

.. code-block:: python

    plot_data(mdl, step='step_load', field='sxx', iptype='min', nodal='min')  # min values of sxx to nodal data

**Note**: using ``nodal='mean'`` with a coarse finite element mesh could give unexpected results. This is because element data can change suddenly across elements in coarse meshes, leading to a mean value at a shared node that is somewhat poorly representative. This effect can be resolved by refining the mesh in the areas where stresses may change quickly or form concentrations, such as near supports, applied loads or areas of peak internal forces and moments.

--------
Colorbar
--------

A colorbar linked to the data will be plotted by default in each plotting layer and to the right-hand-side of the model, the size of which can be controlled by the float ``colorbar_size``. The colorbar limits will range from negative to positive of the maximum data value of the field, even if the results are all positive or negative. The advantage of this, as opposed to using the contracted minimum to maximum range of the data set, is that positive values will always be red, orange and yellow, neutral values green, and negative values blue, indigo and violet. The extremes of the plotted data, as well a selection of evenly spaced intermediate values, will be written as text boxes along the colorbar with the zero point in the middle. If minimum and maximum trim values of the colorbar are given in the argument ``cbar`` when calling ``plot_data()``, for example a maximum ``cbar[1]`` of 3 MPa, then the colorbar ends will cap at 3 MPa and plot red values for all data above 3 MPa. The step and field will also be displayed as a title to the colorbar, and any mode or frequencies placed at the bottom.


------------------
Principal stresses
------------------

As stress is a tensor, any point in the structure has a local axes orientation where maximum and minimum normal stresses occur orthogonally and with zero shear stress. These are the principal stress components ``'smaxp'`` (maximum tensile, or least compressive) and ``'sminp'`` (maximum compressive, or least tensile). By knowing for shell elements the ``'sxx'`` (normal stress in `x`), ``'syy'`` (normal stress in `y`) and ``'sxy'`` (shear stress in `x` and `y`) values at integration points, the orientation of the principal stresses can be determined relative to the element's local axes ``'axes'``. This calculation is based on elementary material mechanics (see Mohr Circles for reference) and has been performed in the plotting function ``plot_principal_stresses()`` for Rhino, which takes argument ``ptype`` as a string either ``'sminp'`` or ``'smaxp'``, a relative ``scale`` to draw the length of vector lines, and if needed a rotation of 90 degrees with `rotate=1`. A call of the experimental Rhino function (currently for triangular shell elements only) will produce the plots below, where lines are drawn to show max principal and min principal vectors:

.. code-block:: python

   rhino.plot_principal_stresses(structure=mdl, step='step_loads', ptype='sminp', scale=0.2)  # min principal

   rhino.plot_principal_stresses(structure=mdl, step='step_loads', ptype='smaxp', scale=0.2)  # max principal
